# Smallworld Core Windows Platforms Standard Core Product Aliases
#
# The Smallworld Product's standard aliases file should not be edited
# by hand.  A user can have personal aliases by placing them in a file
# named `gis_aliases' in his/her home directory, but the alias names
# must be chosen not to clash with those in the standard aliases file.
#
# An alias file should contain one or more stanzas of the form
#
#     <alias>:
#           title      = <title>
#           directory  = <directory>
#           program    = <program>
#           image      = <image>
#           args       = <args>
#           log_file   = <file>
#           timeout    = <seconds>
#           wait_line  = <text>
#           icon_file  = <file>
#           icon_index = <index>
#           product    = <product>
#           interactive = <interactive_or_not>
#           <other>    = <value>
#
# where the meaning of each item is
#
#     alias       The alias name for the command represented by this
#                 stanza.  The name should start with a letter and
#                 contain only letters, digits, `-' and `_'.  Lower-
#                 and uppercase letters are not distinguished.
#
#     title       An arbitrary line of unquoted text, specifying a
#                 title associated with the command alias.  This
#                 simply causes the environment variable
#
#                       SW_GIS_CONSOLE_TITLE
#
#                 to be set to the supplied string: it is up to
#                 the run program whether to notice this and to
#                 display it in some way.  It is also used to
#                 set the title displayed for the command in a
#                 Program Manager Group item.
#
#     directory   The working directory in which to run the program.
#                 If not specified, the current directory is used.
#
#     program     The name of the executable program to run.
#                 Assuming the program can be found in the PATH
#                 (e.g. as set by the environment file), it is
#                 not necessary to specify the directory part of
#                 the program name (nor normally its suffix).
#                 If the program name is not specified, the default
#                 is `sw_magik_win32' unless the image file specified
#		  has the extension ".mi". In that case the default
#		  program name is `gis_magik_win32'.
#
#     image       The name of a Magik image file to pass as argument
#                 to the program.  This item is optional, and should
#                 be specified if and only if <program> expects an
#                 image argument.
#
#     args        This item is optional, and may comprise any
#                 additional arguments to pass to <program>.
#
#     log_file    This item is optional.  It specifies a log file
#                 for standard output and standard error.
#
#     timeout     This item is optional.  It specifies a timeout
#                 for waiting for the application to start.  Only
#                 relevant if a log file is used: a window will
#                 be displayed for timeout seconds saying that the
#                 application is being started.
#
#     wait_line   This item is optional.  It specifies the start
#                 of a line in the log file to wait for on starting
#                 the application: a window will be displayed saying
#                 that the application is being started, until a
#                 matching line appears in the log file.
# 
#     icon_file   This item is optional.  If specified, it should
#                 be the name of a file whose icon is to be used
#                 to identify this command for a Program Manager
#                 Group item.  If not specified, it defaults to
#                 the icon in the GIS launcher program itself.
#
#     icon_index  This item is optional.  If specified, it should
#                 be the index of the icon to use in an icon_file
#                 which contains more than one icon.  If not
#                 specified, it defaults to 1.
#
#     product     This item is optional.  It is intended to be used
#                 to assert that a command is associated with a
#                 particular product (e.g. `base', `view' or `gis').
#
#     interactive This item is optional and only has an effect when 
#                 a log file has been specified. 
#                 If its value is TRUE or T (case insensitive) then
#                 the program runs interactively i.e. standard input
#                 and standard output are connected to a console.
#                 Any other value is taken as false. The wait_line and
#                 timeout items are specified as well as this option,
#                 they will be ignored.
#
#     <other>     Any unrecognised item is taken to be the name of
#                 an environment variable which is to be set to
#                 <value> prior to running the command.
